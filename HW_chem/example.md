# Electron Energy and Light — Answer Key (Markdown)

## Model 1 — White Light

1. **Trace/shade step (diagramming):** Shade each row in the table with the matching rainbow color: Reds, Oranges, Yellows, Greens, Blues, Violets.

2. **What happens to white light when it passes through a prism?**  
   White light is separated into its component colors, forming a continuous spectrum (a rainbow).

3. **Why are the color labels plural (e.g., “Reds”)?**  
   Because each color corresponds to a *range* of wavelengths/energies rather than a single exact value.

4. **Do all colors of light travel at the same speed?**  
   Yes. In a vacuum (and essentially in air), all colors travel at **3.00 × 10^8 m/s**.

5. **Do all colors of light have the same energy? If not, which are highest and least?**  
   No. **Violets** have the highest energy; **Reds** have the least energy.

6. **From the illustrated spectrum:**  
   a. **Longest wavelength:** **Reds** (≈ 625–740 nm).  
   b. **Shortest wavelength:** **Violets** (≈ 380–440 nm).  
   c. **Relationship of wavelength and energy:** As wavelength increases, energy decreases (they are inversely related).

## Model 2 — Emission Spectra for Hydrogen and Boron Atoms

7. **Color the spectral lines:**  
   (Diagramming step) Shade each bright line in the hydrogen and boron spectra with the appropriate observed color.

8. **Hydrogen spectral lines (color and wavelength):**  
   - Violet ≈ **410 nm**  
   - Blue ≈ **434 nm**  
   - Blue‑green ≈ **486 nm**  
   - Red ≈ **656 nm**  

9. **Boron spectral lines (any three examples, color and wavelength):**  
   - Violet ≈ **410 nm**  
   - Blue ≈ **460 nm** (approx.)  
   - Green ≈ **520 nm** (approx.)  
   *(Other lines appear in yellow/red regions as well.)*

10. **Hydrogen: shortest and longest wavelength colors:**  
    a. **Shortest wavelength:** **Violet** (≈ 410 nm).  
    b. **Longest wavelength:** **Red** (≈ 656 nm).

**Notes:**  
- Wavelengths listed are approximate, read from the spectrum scales shown on the worksheet diagrams.  
- Speed of light given is for light in vacuum (c ≈ 3.00 × 10^8 m/s).
