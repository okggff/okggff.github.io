🔰Task Objective:
In this project, we are going to create a 🌐multi-page website for any topic of your choice (school appropriate of course) in order to showcase your web design knowledge.  It can be a website about your favorite movie, artist or book, video game, a personal webpage about your life or maybe showcase a trip or vacation you took. Whatever you want to make, just make sure it looks good 👌😎

Technical Requirements:
📓In our STEM Journal, create a Hand Sketch Wireframe for each webpage we plan to create for our Website. SCAN each sketch and upload here. (⏰Due: Friday, August 28🗓️)

Our website (multiple pages) must have content from each of the lessons listed below:
Lesson 1: Lists, paragraphs, horizontal rules, break tags and title/meta tags.
Lesson 2: External, Internal, Jump and Mailto Links tags.
Lesson 3: CSS, Semantic Tags,  Video, Audio, iframe tags.
Lesson 4: Table, with formatting included.
NOTE: Cascading Style Sheets. Style changes on the page should be done through the external CSS and not the HTML or inline CSS. Some inline CSS is okay, by the majority of the page edits should be done with CSS sheet. The pages must be linked to a style sheet (styles.css). 
A BIG part of our grade for this website is also going to be appearance and usability of the site. So make sure that our website looks nice and is easy to navigate!! ☝️😎
